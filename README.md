 In this project I mastered:
 - work with DOM
 - using RESTful API 
 - work with asynchronous requests
 - search organizationll-component
 - SCSS
 
 CSS and JS separated by folders. All files are in the `src` folder.
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
 - clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/lp-msarchitect/movie-search.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 - `cd movie-search`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm start`
